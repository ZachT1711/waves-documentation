# Asset script

An **asset script** is a [RIDE script](/ride/script.md) that is attached to an asset with a [set asset script transaction](/blockchain/transaction-type/set-asset-script-transaction.md).

An asset with the attached script is called a smart asset.

You can attach a script to an asset only during the creation of the asset.
