## How to receive Asset

Think of the Waves account as a multi-wallet. It, obviously, supports Waves and also any other token existing on the Waves blockchain. Whenever you want to receive Waves based asset, just hand your personal Waves address to the sender and he is able to execute the transaction.

You can use either [**Online app**](https://dex.wavesplatform.com), or standalone version for [**Windows app**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesDEX-win.zip), [**Mac OS app**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesDEX-mac.dmg) or [**Linux app**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesDEX-linux.deb). All versions support automatic update.

Open your Waves wallet. At the top right corner click on the **Account avatar**.

## How to use sponsored fee

Waves users can also use a sponsored fee to pay for outgoing transfers. Check your **Portfolio**, if you see a token with **%** icon. So it means you can change the default Waves fee to another sponsored token.

So how to do it? Just create an outgoing transfer described above and click on the **WAVES** under **Transaction Fee**.
Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
