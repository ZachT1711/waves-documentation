## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Bitcoin SV on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Bitcoins Cash are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Bitcoin SV token \(wBSV\) issued in the Waves blockchain. Every single Bitcoin SV token is backed 1:1 with the real Bitcoin SV.

## How to use sponsored fee

Waves users can also use a sponsored fee to pay for outgoing transfers. Check your **Portfolio**, if you see a token with **%** icon. So it means you can change the default Waves fee to another sponsored token.

So how to do it? Just create an outgoing transfer described above and click on the **WAVES** under **Transaction Fee**.
Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
