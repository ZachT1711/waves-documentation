# Lease Your WAVES

## Introduction

[**LPoS (Leased Proof of Stake)**](/blockchain/leasing.md) gives you the opportunity to make the network stronger and safer while receiving more Waves and other assets as a reward for doing so. It's the so called **Leasing**.

Most people don't have 1000 WAVES to run their own node, so they are still able to help the whole project through leasing their Waves to someone who is able to run a node.

> Most big nodes pay in a one week cycle to their users. The LPoS reward depends on the conditions of the selected pool.  
> We do not regulate the payment process, so before using LPoS service, please read carefully the terms of payment and do your investigation of the pool that you want to use.  
> The terms can vary between LPOS pools. Please use the list of nodes - [https://forum.wavesplatform.com/c/pools](https://forum.wavesplatform.com/c/pools)
