Waves app will display an important reminder. Never provide your backup phrase to anyone except the official Waves client. We recommend that you write the backup phrase on a piece of paper and store it in a secure location. Do not store the backup phrase unencrypted on any electronic device.

After that, you will get account seed phrase.  
Waves app wants to make sure you actually wrote down the backup phrase. Therefore, Waves app will ask you to verify the backup phrase before proceeding to your Waves account.  
Create several copies of the seed phrase and click on **I've written it down**
