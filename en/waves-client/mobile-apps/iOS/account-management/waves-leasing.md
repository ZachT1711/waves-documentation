## Introduction

[**LPoS \(Leased Proof of Stake\)**](/blockchain/leasing.md) gives you the opportunity to make the network stronger and safer while receiving more Waves and other assets as a reward for doing so. It's the so called **Leasing**.

Most people don't have 1000 WAVES to run their own node, so they are still able to help the whole project through leasing their Waves to someone who is able to run a node.

> Most big nodes pay in a one week cycle to their users. The LPoS reward depends on the conditions of the selected pool.
We do not regulate the payment process, so before using LPoS service, please read carefully the terms of payment and do your investigation of the pool that you want to use.
The terms can vary between LPOS pools. Please use the list of LPoS pools - https://forum.wavesplatform.com/c/pools

The Leasing section has two boxes: one to specify the recipient address which would be the address of any mining pool, one to specify the amount you are willing to lease.

Fill in the fields and click on the **Start Lease**. Recheck entered data and click on the **Confirm**.

Once you press the **Start Lease**, you will be forwarded to the main **Leasing** page. There you will see the status of active leases in the **Leased** line.
