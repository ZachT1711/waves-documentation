Please take some time to understand some important things for your own safety. We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your backup phrase (aka SEED phrase). By continuing to use our platform, you agree to accept all risks associated with the loss of your SEED, including but not limited to the inability to obtain your funds and dispose of them. In case you lose your SEED, you agree and acknowledge that the Waves Platform would not be responsible for the negative consequences of this.

To continue, click on the **Next**.
We strongly recommend reading all articles before you begin.

Now, it's an important step to backup your account. To start the process click on the **Back Up Now**.

Never provide your backup phrase to anyone except the official Waves client. We recommend that you write the backup phrase on a piece of paper and store it in a secure place. Do not store the backup phrase unencrypted on any electronic devices.

You can restore your wallet only from the seed phrase. If you lose your seed, there is no way to recover your money. This is why we ask you to save your seed in the safe place.
