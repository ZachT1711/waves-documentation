# About Waves Token Rating

**Waves Token Rating** is an online service (<https://tokenrating.wavesexplorer.com>) that shows ratings of [tokens](/blockchain/token.md) (projects) issued on the Waves Platform.

User can rate any token from the web browser in which [Waves Keeper](/waves-keeper/about-waves-keeper.md) is installed if there is at least 1 [WCT](/blockchain/token/wct.md) on users' address balance. The amount of WCT on the balance affects the [weight of the user's rate W<sub>n</sub>](/waves-token-rating/rating-formula.md).

At the time when user rates a token, he pays a [fee](/blockchain/transaction/transaction-fee.md) in [WAVES](/blockchain/token/waves.md) for the [data transaction](/blockchain/transaction-type/data-transaction.md).
